# Stateful Smart Contracts On Cardano

## Part 1.

### Minting Unique Tokens With A Shared `PolicyId`

## Problem

Our goals:

1. We want to distribute a smart contract's state over mutiple UTxOs, _and_...

2. ... We need to ensure that it cannot be compromised by an attacker.

Otherwise, it would be pointless to use whatever abstractions we might come up with.

---

## Problem

An informal statement of the problem might be the following.

> A smart contract's state, distributed over a set of UTxOs, should be modified only by transactions validated by the smart contract itself.

---

## Problem

There are good news and bad news.

* **Good news**: Smart contracts (on-chain) can enforce the recipient(s) of the UTxOs being created, but...

* **Bad news**: ... They have **zero knowledge** about the sender of the UTxOs being spent.

Why is that a problem?

## Problem

Compromised state could be the source of other, more serious issues. 

What could be worse than WW3? Well, for example:

> _You_ could be losing money!!

While total thermonuclear annihilation might be somewhat tolerable and even fun, losing money is not and we must avoid that at all costs.

---

## Native Tokens

Native tokens, also called _assets_, are defined as:

* $\text{AssetId} := \text{PolicyId} \times \text{AssetName}$
* $\text{PolicyId} := (\mathbb{F}_{256})^{28}$ (hash of the minting validator script)
* $\text{AssetName} := (\mathbb{F}_{256})^{32}$ (arbitrary string)

Where $\mathbb{F}_q := \lbrace 0,\dots,q-1 \rbrace$.

---

## Spending Validators

We call $V$ the type of a Spending Validator:

$$
V := (\text{Datum} \times \text{Redeemer} \times \text{ScriptContext}) \rightarrow \mathbb{B}
$$

---

## Minting Validators

We call $M$ the type of a Minting Validator:

$$
M := (\text{Redeemer} \times \text{ScriptContext}) \rightarrow \mathbb{B}
$$

**NB**: Minting Validators do not take a $\text{Datum}$ as inputs, because they do not spend UTxOs.

---

## Minting The NFTs

Let $\text{OutputReference}$ represent an on-chain reference to an UTxO.

We declare the following functions that produce smart contracts:

* $new_m : (\text{OutputReference}) \rightarrow M$

* $add_m : M \rightarrow M$

* $add_v : (M \times M) \rightarrow V$

---

## Minting The NFTs

$newm$ takes an $\text{OutputReference}$ `utxo` and returns a Minting Validator that produces a single token with $\text{AssetName}$ `"Auth"`.

Such script is a **one-time** minting validator, because it ensures that `utxo` is consumed in the transaction (which can happen only once).

---

## Minting The NFTs

In particular, let $o$ an UTxO reference.

* $S_m = new_m(o)$

* $A_m = add_m(s_M)$

* $A_v = add_v(s_M, a_M)$

**NB** Cyan UTxOs contain the minted NFTs that we will use to authenticate our smart contract's state.
